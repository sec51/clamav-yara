### Convert ClamAV definitions to Yara rules [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sec51/clamav-yara.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sec51/clamav-yara)

---

### Clamav To Yara features:

* Downloads the definitions periodically from clamav: at the moment hard coded in main.go to 4 hours

* Checks the definitions were changes via Etag

* ON HOLD: Checks the hash of the definitions files is valid. Got around it by installing clamav on our servers with freshclam and setting the URLs to our servers, which downloads in HTTPS

* Extract the signatures and generate YARA rules. At the moment the ClamAV file parsed are: NDB, HDB, HSB. MDB and MSB are done as well, but need to find a way to generate proper YARA rules with that.

---

### How to generate the rules

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sec51/clamav-yara.git

cd clamav-yara

go build

go test -v

./clamav-yara
```

You can then find the generated Yara rules inside the `rules` folder

### TODO

* Use FILE module on OSX and LINUX to detect the file type and scan that specific file only.

* Test if FILE, PE, ELF module cause memory leaks

* Wait for Golang 1.6 and hope that they introduce the {{- end}} tag in the template package, to remove the empty spaces.
